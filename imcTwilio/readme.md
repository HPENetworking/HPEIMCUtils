#IMC And Twilio

Twilio is web-based messaging service that will allow you to make an API call to send an SMS message to a cel phone service, among other things.

This proof-of-concept code allows a user to gather the current real-time alarms on the IMC system and send them to a SMS endpoint

This code should not be put in production as is and is only provided as a proof of concept.
